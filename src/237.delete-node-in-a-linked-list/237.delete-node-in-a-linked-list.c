//  Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

// Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

// Example 1:

// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
// Output: [4,1,9]
// Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
// Example 2:

// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
// Output: [4,5,9]
// Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

// Note:

// The linked list will have at least two elements.
// All of the nodes' values will be unique.
// The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
// Do not return anything from your function.
void deleteNode(struct ListNode *node)
{
    // Accepted
    // 41/41 cases passed (8 ms)
    // Your runtime beats 51.75 % of c submissions
    // Your memory usage beats 74.07 % of c submissions (7.7 MB)
    node->val = node->next->val;
    node->next = node->next->next;
