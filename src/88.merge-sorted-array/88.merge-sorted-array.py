# [88] Merge Sorted Array
#
# Note: I am compare the least at first,but it is very fool to sort the list again and again ,this solution though is based on the top voted Solution and use less memory

# Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

# Note:

# The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
# You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
# Example:

# Input:
# nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
# nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
